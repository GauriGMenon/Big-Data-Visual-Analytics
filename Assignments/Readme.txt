Question 1: 2D Isocontour Extraction
    My file's name is "assignment2-1.py". It takes the isocontour value as decimal input in the command line as an argument.
    The script will produce an output file of the name "countour.vtp". Eg: python3 assignment2-1.py 500.

Question 2: VTK Volume Rendering and Transfer Function
    My file's name is "assignment2-2.py". It takes the Phong Shade as "ON" or "OFF" in the command line as an argument.
    It will render the 3D volume data. Eg: python3 assignment2-2.py ON.
